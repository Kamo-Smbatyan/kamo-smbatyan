            Blockchain technology offers a level of security and transparency
            that is particularly beneficial for AI systems. By decentralizing
            data storage, blockchain ensures that AI algorithms can access a
            wide variety of data without compromising data integrity or privacy.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Data Integrity: Blockchain's immutable ledger ensures that once
              data is recorded, it cannot be altered, providing a trustworthy
              foundation for AI models to analyze.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved AI Security: The decentralized nature of blockchain
              prevents single points of failure, significantly enhancing the
              security of AI systems against attacks.
