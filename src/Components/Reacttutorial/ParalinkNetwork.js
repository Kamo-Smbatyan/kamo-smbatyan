              into the runtime posed its own set of challenges, particularly in
              ensuring compatibility across various environments. This required
              meticulous testing and debugging across different platforms to
              ensure consistent behavior. The effort paid off, as the final
              implementation provided a flexible and secure execution
              environment, capable of running complex smart contracts
              efficiently.

                Network can be deployed using Docker. Docker provides a
                consistent environment that can be easily shared and replicated
                across different development and production setups. To start a
                single-node development chain in Docker, use the following
                command:
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code>./scripts/docker_run.sh</code>
              </pre>
              <p>
                This command compiles the code and then starts a local
                development network. You can also customize the command by
                appending your own, such as running the Substrate node without
                recompiling:
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  ./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/paralink-node --dev
                  --ws-external
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>
                Other useful Docker commands include purging the local dev
                chain:
